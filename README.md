# Land-Use-Simulation
Multi-agent reinforcement learning model. This project is a simplified example of the long-term objective of this analysis. 

## Overview
The Urban Development Simulation project creates a multi-agent environment to study the interplay between developer actions focused on maximizing rewards and broader urban planning objectives. Using a reinforcement learning approach, it models how individual decision-makers interact with and shape the urban landscape.

## Objective
This simulation seeks to understand how reward-maximizing behavior by developers, modeled as agents within the simulation, impacts urban planning and development. By observing agent decisions and the resulting urban configurations, the project aims to gather insights applicable to real-world urban planning challenges.

## Implementation
- **Dynamic Agents**: Multiple agents operate within a grid-based simulation, each making decisions on residential or commercial development based on a strategy to maximize rewards.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The core of the simulation uses a Q-learning model with neural networks, enabling agents to adapt and refine their strategies over time.
- **Decision Constraints**: Agents are constrained by budgetary limits, reflecting real-world financial limitations faced by developers.
- **Visualization Tools**: The simulation comes equipped with tools to visualize the grid and the decision-making process of agents, providing insights into the dynamics of urban development.

## Motivation
This project highlights the importance of considering individual developer incentives in urban planning. Understanding the reward mechanisms can inform more effective planning strategies that align developer behavior with urban sustainability and livability goals. This simulation is a step towards leveraging AI and machine learning to innovate in urban development strategy and planning.
